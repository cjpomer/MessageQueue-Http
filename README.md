# MessageQueue-Http
Proof of concept to examine transitioning from a message queue to an HTTP server

This is a place to examine and compare the semantics of messaage queues and HTTP servers.  The underlying goal is to examine how to develop a reusable component that facilitates hybrid on-prem/cloud scenarios.

I am evolving these thoughts and ideas over time and attempting to keep track of them within git.  As I make a substantive change, I will create a new branch and keep developing in master.
